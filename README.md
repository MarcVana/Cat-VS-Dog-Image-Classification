# Cat VS Dog Image Classification
This is a good project to start off as a beginner in Deep Learning.
The model takes an image as an input and determines whether the image contains a picture of a dog or a cat.
There is a simple GUI made with Tkinter.
The answer will contain the class of the image (dog/cat) and the percentage.

The model is built with Keras, Tensorflow GPU 2.x.
